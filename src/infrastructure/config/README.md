# Config

The `config` directory centralizes all configuration files related to the application.

## Structure (examples)

- `process/` – Environment and process-related configurations.
- `database/` – Database connection and ORM configurations.
- `cache/` – Cache and session management configurations.

## Why?

A centralized configuration approach improves maintainability and makes it easier to manage different environments.
